### Grading

This class is graded on the following criteria:

* 10% Attendance & class participation
* 40% Weekly homework
* 30% Midterm (pair) & final programming assignments (15% each)
* 20% Midterm & final exams (10% each)


**Homework and lateness**   Homework assignments are individual assignments unless explicitly described otherwise. Late homework assignments will be penalized by 20% per day late, with no credit possible after 4 days late. Any extension requests for any reason should be made through the Student Accessibility and Accommodations office.

There will be two larger-scale programming assignments (projects) which you will have more time to work on. The first of these will be given around the middle of the semester and may (optionally) be done in pairs. In it, you will solve a moderately challenging problem using Prolog. The second, given around the end of the semester, will be to solve the same problem using Haskell. The second project will be done individually. The same lateness policy applies for these projects as for the regular homework assignments.
