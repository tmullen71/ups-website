### Grading

This class is graded on the following criteria:

* 10% Attendance & class participation
* 40% Weekly homework
* 30% Midterm (pair) & final programming assignments (15% each)
* 20% Midterm & final exams (10% each)


**Homework and lateness**   Homework assignments are individual assignments unless explicitly described otherwise. Late homework assignments will be penalized by 20% per day late, with no credit possible after 4 days late. Any extension requests for any reason should be made through the Student Accessibility and Accommodations office.

There will be two larger-scale programming assignments (projects) which you will have more time to work on. The first of these will be given around the middle of the semester and may (optionally) be done in pairs. In it, you will solve a moderately challenging problem using Prolog. The second, given around the end of the semester, will be to solve the same problem using Haskell. The second project will be done individually. The same lateness policy applies for these projects as for the regular homework assignments.

#### Coding homework grade rubric

Grades on coding assignments are at the discretion of the grader (or myself, depending on the arrangement for the term). The general guidelines for how you should expect your code to be assessed are below. If you feel your work has been wrongly evaluated, please contact me directly.

**100%** Implements all requested functionality as specified in the instructions. Results are identical to expected results. Code is well organized and commented, and Haskell functions have explicit type declarations.

**85%-99%** Implements all requested functionality but loses points for style or very minor functionality issues. "Very minor" is subjective, but could refer to situations where the student clearly understands the concepts being dealt with but has overlooked some detail in the implementation. Unnecessarily verbose or complex solutions will also fall into this category. In the case of Haskell, otherwise correct function definitions without type declarations may fall into this category.

**50%-85%** Mostly works and follows the instructions but has significant functionality issues: e.g. appears to work but returns the wrong answer (in more than minor details), breaks or fails to return on some expected input values, etc. (If the program works but breaks on unexpected input, it will be noted whether students were required to implement exception handling of any kind. If not, it is assumed that input should be limited to expected values, and points are not docked for breaking on bad input. Prolog programs' behavior after pressing the semicolon falls into this gray area).

**10%-50%** Some required functionality is correctly or near-correctly implemented. E.g., a required predicate or function is implemented correctly, but issues elsewhere in the program make the program fail (including failing to compile) overall. If your program fails to compile (i.e. cannot be consulted, in the case of Prolog) you should expect your grade to fall in this range, at best.

**0%-%10** Program has no redeeming components; student wrote essentially no code, or code that is not clearly recognizable as the correct language. Code may fail to compile or may compile trivially. (Partial credit under %10 may include, for example, syntactically correct, originally-named predicate or function definitions without rule bodies or content, or well-formed Haskell type declarations without associated functions defined.)​​
