### Grading

Homework for this class will be submitted electronically, and must be turned in by class time on the due date for

* Attendance
* Homework
* Exams (one midterm and one final)
* Programming projects (one midterm in pairs, one final as individuals)

**Homework and lateness**   Homework assignments are individual assignments. You will typically have 1-2 weeks for each assignment. There are no extensions given. Late homework assignments will be penalized by <span class="latex">3^n\% </span> for n â‰¤ 4 where n is the number of days the assignment is submitted late.

There will be two larger-scale programming assignments (projects) which you will have more time to work on. The first of these will be given around the middle of the semester and may (optionally) be done in pairs. In it, you will solve a moderately challenging problem using Prolog. The second, given around the end of the semester, will be to solve the same problem using Haskell. The second project will be done individually. The same lateness policy applies for these projects as for the regular homework assignments.
