### Required software

You should install Blender before the first lab. Download Blender for your platform [here](https://www.blender.org/download/) and follow the instructions. 

Three.js and its related libraries will be provided with the starter code, so you don't need to download this yourself. You should, however, ensure that you can run a local http server for viewing your web pages locally. (It is possible to view files and web pages directly from the local filesystems but many browsers place limitations on this, which can lead to unexpected behavior.) I recommend Node.js [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) but any server you are comfortable with will do.
