Upload each assignment to its own directory inside your `public_html` directory using FileZilla. Be sure that all dependencies are in place and **Double check that your finished work displays properly in a browser online.** Upload Assignment 13 into one directory, then duplicate the project and work on Assignment 14 separately. When you complete Assignment 14, upload it into its own directory alongside the others. 

In Moodle, upload the completed `README.txt` with any necessary questions answered.

The Moodle page for Assignment 13 is [here](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=340294).

The Moodle page for Assignment 14 is [here](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=340294).
