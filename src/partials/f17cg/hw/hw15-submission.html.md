For web-based projects, upload the project to its own directory inside your `public_html` directory using FileZilla. Be sure that all dependencies are in place and **Double check that your finished work displays properly in a browser online.** The directory should include the completed `README.txt`, which should also be viewable in the browser.

In Moodle, add a link to your finished assignment's public URL.

For non-web-based projects, upload your completed project in a .zip archive to the Moodle page. Be sure to include a detailed Readme file describing what you did.
