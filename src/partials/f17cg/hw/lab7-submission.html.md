Labs can be done in pairs. For submitting labs, **either of the partners** should upload the completed lab diretory into their `public_html` directory using an FTP client such as Filezilla, as with an ordinary assignment. Be sure that all dependencies are in place and **Double check that your finished work displays properly in a browser online.** 

In Moodle, **both partners** should submit a link to the finished lab's public URL. **You must have a submission associated with your name on Moodle to get credit for the lab.**

The Moodle page for this assignment is [here](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=408150).
