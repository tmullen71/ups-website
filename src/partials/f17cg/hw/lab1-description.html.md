## Getting started with Blender

This lab will be tutorial style. Follow along with my instructions on your own computer. We'll cover the very basics of navigating the Blender interface and 3D space. Most of what we'll cover is covered in more depth in Chapter 1 of [Introducing Character Animation with Blender](/~tmullen/secure/f17cg/IntroducingCharacterAnimationWithBlender2E.pdf). 

The important points of this tutorial/lab are:

* Understanding windows, editors, and headers in the Blender interface
  * How to switch editor types using the header drop-down
  * How to split and unify windows by dragging corners
* Navigating the 3D viewport
  * Using number keys 1, 3, 7, and 0 to change views quickly
  * Using number key 5 to toggle perspective/orthographic view
  * Zooming the view with mouse wheel or Ctrl+MMB
  * Panning the view with Shift+MMB
  * Rotating the view with MMB
  * Alt+LMB as a replacement for MMB
* Working with 3D objects
  * Selecting with right click
  * Grabbing (moving) objects with G key
  * Rotating objects with R key
  * Scaling objects with S key
  * Constraining transformations to axes with X, Y, or Z keys
  
Don't hesitate to ask questions! These explanations can go quickly and it's easy to miss a detail here and there. If something isn't going as it ought to, let me know!
