## Overview

This assignment is intended to give you an opportunity to exercise your creativity and explore graphics technologies independently. The project is weighted double an ordinary assignment towards your grade for the class.

In this assignment you'll choose one of three possible project options: **Interactive 3D (Three.js) option**, **Ray tracer option**, or **Modeling for 3D printing option**. These options are described in more detail below:

* **Interactive 3D (Three.js) option** For this option, you will create an interactive 3D environment with Three.js. This may be a game, an architectural or other sort of walkthrough, a data visualization environment, or an interactive media artwork. There are no rules regarding what type of work it is, but there are some requirements. The project must have the following characteristics:
  * It must have a significant interactive component. I.e., users should be able to interact with the content in an interesting way. This may mean exploring an environment in a first-person walkthrough style, controlling an avatar, interacting with views for data visualization, et cetera.
  * It should contain at least 5 objects, at least 5 materials, and at least 3 textures (environment textures and cube maps count as single textures). It can of course contain more than this. If your idea is sufficiently complex and does *not* involve using this many assets, please check with me in advance.
  * It should make use of at least 2 features of Three.js that you have not yet dealt with directly in other assignments (it's okay if similar features were used in starter files, such as how picking was used in the Barycentric coordinate assignment starter file). Acceptable features could include, for example, skeleton animation, bump maps, picking, physics simulation, or GLSL shaders. Check the [Three.js homepage](http://threejs.org/), [Alteredqualia.com](http://alteredqualia.com/), and [Stemkoski's site](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/) for many great examples. Your project may of course make use of more than 2 features.
  * You *may* make use of models, textures, materials, or shaders that you find online, provided you clearly give appropriate credit in the readme, you respect any license restrictions on the content, and the main coding work of the project is your own. Recommended resources include:
    * Models and Blender materials from [Blendswap](http://www.blendswap.com)
    * GLSL shaders from [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com/)


* **Ray tracer option** For this option, you will continue working on the ray tracer you began for assignment 11, implementing *at least* 3 features from the following list (in no particular order):
  * Transparency/diffraction
  * Antialiasing
  * Texture mapping
  * Environment mapping
  * Soft shadows
  * Depth of field
  * Motion blur
  * Matrix transformations
  <p>

  [Shirley Chapter 13](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=340287) is a good reference for moving forward with these topics.

  The ray tracer option is only available to people who have turned in a working implementation of the basic ray tracer (assignments 13 & 14) on time.

* **Modeling for 3D printing option** For this option, you will create and 3D print a model using Blender (or another 3D modeling tool of your choice). 

  * The model may be either an example of inorganic (mechanical) modeling or of organic modeling, and may be created using any combination of mesh modeling, sculpting, or modifiers in Blender. The final print should have *at east* two parts that may be glued or snapped together. The finished piece will be evaluated based upon the following criteria:
    * Complexity (Are there multiple parts, details, or interesting characteristics?)
    * Structural ntegrity (Do parts fit together well? Are details well supported?)
    * Economy (Are volumes hollow where they should be? Does the arrangement of pieces for printing make use of the space?)
    * Aesthetics (Is the model pleasing and well-executed?)
    <p>

  **Important:** The 3D printing option will require independent learning, as many of the skills required will rely on practice and study of techniques beyond what is covered in class. Furthermore, due to time limitations for using the 3D printer, this option is only open to a maximum of 4 students. Students who wish to choose the VFX option must submit a proposal and a modeling sample by Week 8 of class. If more than 4 students submit proposals and modeling samples, I will select based on the quality of proposals and modeling samples. Finally, students should be aware that 3D printing takes time and that the 3D printer schedule will be divided among those 4 students (and any other users from outside the class) on a first-come/first-served basis, which will require that the modeling be done early in order to present a completed print by the assignment deadline.

Regardless of which assignment you choose, be sure to describe what you did and what your goal was with the project in the Readme file. Discuss challenges or problems that arose and describe what you learned in your attempts to solve the problems, and any other points you think I should take into consideration when grading the assignment.

## Presentation 

Final projects will be presented to the class briefly during the scheduled finals period, and grades for the projects will be partially based on peer evaluations. Presenting your project and evaluating others' projects is mandatory and cannot be made up. Requests for exceptions for medical reasons can be made through the dean of students. 

## Submission

If your project is web-based, upload the project to its own directory inside your `public_html` directory using FileZilla. Be sure that all dependencies are in place and **Double check that your finished work displays properly in a browser online.** The directory should include the completed `README.txt`, which should also be viewable in the browser.

In Moodle, add a link to your finished assignment's public URL.
The Moodle page for this assignment is [here](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=340426).

If your project is not web-based (e.g. a VFX project), upload a zip file containing **all relevant assets and files, including a README.txt** to the Moodle page for the assignment. This should include (at least) the final video output, the original raw video input, the .blend file(s) used to do the compositing, and any models, textures, shaders, etc used. If your assets are too big to upload easily to the Moodle page in this way, include appropriate download links.
