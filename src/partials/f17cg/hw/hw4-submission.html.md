Upload the project to its own directory inside your `public_html` directory using FileZilla. Be sure that all dependencies are in place and **Double check that your finished work displays properly in a browser online.** The directory should include the completed `README.txt`, which should also be viewable in the browser.

In Moodle, add a link to your finished assignment's public URL **and a screenshot of your project displayed in a browser, with the URL visible**.

In Moodle, submit **only** the link to your assignment directory on the shared server containing the fully implemented assignment and readme.txt.
