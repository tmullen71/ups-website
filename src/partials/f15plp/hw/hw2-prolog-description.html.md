## Submitting

Write all the predicates and facts for this assignment in one file, called
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, 'Lucida Sans Typewriter', 'Lucida Typewriter', monospace;">hwk2-&lt;your_name&gt;.plg</span>. Separate the code for each exercise within the file with comments indicating which code goes with which exercise. Put your own name in a comment at the top of the file. Like so:

<pre>%Your Name
%
%Exercise 1

...

%Exercise 2

...

</pre>

Submit the file on [Moodle]().

Of course, you should make sure you programs are working before submitting them.
Make a note in the comments if you had trouble getting the program to work.

## Exercise 1

A while back [a story from the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/may/20/can-you-do-the-maths-puzzle-for-vietnamese-eight-year-olds-that-has-stumped-parents-and-teachers) went viral about Vietnamese schoolchildren solving a challenging puzzle by correctly inserting the digits 1 to 9 (with no repetitions) into the following maze to form a correct equation:

While I applaud any third grader who can solve this puzzle, I think it would be easier just to let Prolog do the work! For this exercise, write a Prolog program that generates correct answers to the puzzle (there may be more than one). The answers should be in the form of a list of digits which would be entered into the blanks in the maze from left to right. Name the predicate **mathmaze** and have it take one argument, which gets instantiated as the correct list of numbers (and gives other answers when prompted with **;**).

Two convenient built-in predicates that you may want to use are

<pre>
member(Element, List).
</pre>

which is true if Element is a member of the list and

<pre>
delete(List, Element, RemainingElementsList).
</pre>

which, if given List and Element, will generate RemainingElementsList containing the original list with only Element removed.

Finally, to make Prolog do arithmetic, we use the **is** operator. So, to instantiate a variable called Sum with the sum of 5 and 5 would look like this:

<pre>
?- Sum is 5 + 5.
Sum = 10
</pre>
