###Course description

In this class students will study the fundamentals of computer graphics with a focus on practical graphics programming. Lectures and readings will cover the theoretical concepts behind common graphical processes and touch upon the mathematical foundations. Necessary mathematical concepts will be reviewed as they are encountered, but an understanding of basic linear algebra, trigonometry, and parametric functions is strongly recommended.

The practical component of the class will use Three.js, a high-level WebGL-based graphics library for JavaScript. Students will also implement a ray tracer on their own using JavaScript. A variety of other technologies and environments will be introduced and students will choose from several options of graphics-related final projects.
