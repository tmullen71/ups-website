## Evaluation

Completing this assignment on time to the specifications described above is worth 8 points out of a possible 10 points. Further points will be awarded on the basis of creativity, design, and/or additional complexity. If you used interesting features of Three.js that have not been discussed, or if you added something to the assignment that may not be immediately obvious to me, be sure to make a note of it in the README, so that I know what to credit you for.

## Submitting
