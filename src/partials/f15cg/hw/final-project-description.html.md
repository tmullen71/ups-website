## Overview

In this assignment you're going to choose one of two possible project options:

* **Interactive 3D option** For this option, you will create an interactive 3D environment with Three.js. This may be a game, an architectural or other sort of walkthrough, a data visualization environment, or an interactive media artwork. There are no rules regarding what type of work it is, but there are some requirements. The project must have the following characteristics:
    * It must have a significant interactive component, with multiple modes of interaction. I.e., it should have more than just a couple of DAT.gui sliders. Users should be able to interact with the content in an interesting way.
    * It should contain at least 5 objects, at least 5 materials, and at least 5 textures (environment textures and cube maps count as single textures).
    * It should make use of at least 3 features of Three.js that you have not yet dealt with in other assignments. These could include anything from bump maps, to picking, to physics simulation.

* **VFX option** For this option, you will create a short video (one shot) with a 3D VFX component using Open Shading Language in Blender. The theme of the video will be "A Mysterious Power". It can be of any length and include any content you wish, with the following criteria:
    * The shot must make use of either camera tracking or object tracking or both to integrate the effect.
    * Some part of the effect must be created using an OSL shader in Cycles. You *may* adapt a GLSL shader that you found online, for example at [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com/). If you do this, make it clear in the README what you adapted and where it came from originally.

This assignment will be graded on execution and creativity.
