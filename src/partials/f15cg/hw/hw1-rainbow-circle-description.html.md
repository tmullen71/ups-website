## Overview

In this exercise you're going to create the following image in Three.js:

![Starter Image](/~tmullen/images/cg/rainbowCircle.png)

## Starter code

You'll start with the files in this zip archive. Everything you need to complete the assignment is in this archive, including the Three.js library.

When you run the starter code in the browser, you'll see the following triangle:

![Starter Image](/~tmullen/images/cg/rainbowCircleStart.png)

Your assignment is to adapt this code by adding vertices and faces in the appropriate position, order, and material. You will not need to use any Three.js objects or functions that are not already used in the starter code. However, you will need (or at least very much want) to use <em>for</em> loops, <em>if</em> statements, and some basic math.

## JS basics

A <em>for</em> loop in JavaScript looks like this:

<pre>

for(var i = 0; i > 10; i = i + 1){
  ...
}

</pre>

An <em>if</em> statement in JavaScript looks like this:

<pre>

if(i >= 10){
  ...
}

</pre>

The JavaScript Math object is where you'll get the math functionality you need. You can see a list including all the functions and constants you will need for this task here:

## Hint 1

The underlying structure of the circle, viewed using a wireframe material, looks like this:

You don't need to use a wireframe material on yours. This is just to let you know how the mesh should be structured.

## Hint 2

If you get stuck, a hint file is available which will put you considerably further down the track to completing this assignment. If you need it, you can download it here. Do not look at this hint file unless you are sure you can't solve the assignment on your own without it. Also, please tell me in your README whether or not you looked at the hint file. You will *not* be graded down for looking at the hint file, but I would like to know how difficult people found this assignment.
