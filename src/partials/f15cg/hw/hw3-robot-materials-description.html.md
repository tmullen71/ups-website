## Overview

In this exercise you're going to continue working on your robot by giving it materials with various characteristics.

There is no starter file. Simply duplicate the previous assignment where you left off and continue with that.

## Requirements

The robot should use at least five materials, among which should be at least one diffuse (matte/non-shiny) material and at least one highly specular (shiny) material. Also, there should be at least one transparent material like glass, and at least one environment-mapped reflective material (it's okay to have materials with both, but there should be at least two materials in total to correspond with these characteristics).

Finally, include a sky box to help make transparent materials more interesting (by giving them something to see through to). Instructions on creating a sky box in Three.js can be found [here](http://blog.romanliutikov.com/post/58705840698/skybox-and-environment-map-in-threejs).

I've provided a set of sky box images you can use [here](/~tmullen/cg/airport_images.zip). If you want to create your own, there are some instructions for doing that in Blender [here](http://25x8.blogspot.com/2013/04/rendering-skybox-for-unity-using-blender.html).

Here is an example of a finished assignment:

## Evaluation

Completing this assignment on time to the specifications described above is worth 8 points out of a possible 10 points. Further points will be awarded on the basis of creativity, design, and/or additional complexity. If you used interesting features of Three.js that have not been discussed, or if you added something to the assignment that may not be immediately obvious to me, be sure to make a note of it in the README, so that I know what to credit you for.  

## Submitting

To submit this work, upload it with all necessary files in its own subdirectory of your public_html directory so that it can be viewed in a browser. Test it in a browser to make sure that it's working! (If it works differently in different browsers make a note of that in the README file).

After you've uploaded the work and checked it in the browser, submit the README.txt to Moodle.
