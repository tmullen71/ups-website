## Overview

In this assignment, you will follow the instructions on the [Seattle take-home assignment](https://seattle.poly.edu/wiki/EducationalAssignments/TakeHome) to take a slightly more in-depth look at the Seattle networking environment than the tutorial we did in class. Please do this assignment **individually**.

There's no coding involved with this assignment, and it shouldn't take a lot of time, but it's important to get familiar with the environment and understand how to use vessels and the Seattle shell, in order to move on to your next assignment, where you'll implement a reliable transport protocol using the tools provided by the Repy API. In order to do the assignment, you'll need the Seattle demokit files (which includes such files ass `helloworld.repy` and others that you'll use in the assignment). You can download that [here](http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/~tmullen/secure/s18nw/demokit.zip). 

### Getting started with Seattle

We will be going through the process of getting set up on Seattle Clearinghouse and using the `repy` tools in class. You will need an account and API key on Seattle Clearinghouse. This is managed via the web interface [here](https://seattleclearinghouse.poly.edu/html/login).

In order to run your code on remote vessels, you'll need to get some vessels via the web interface at the Seattle Clearinghouse. You will need to do this *at least* once each time you sit down to do any coding, as they expire within a couple of hours. It's likely you'll have to do it more often than that. You may not be able to get 10 vessels at once in the environment you want them (LAN or WAN). You will only ever need two working vessels, but it helps to have a few to choose from. 

Once you've got some vessels, you should open up a terminal on your computer and follow the instructions on the assignment page. Some things to pay attention to:

* You'll need to be in the directory with the scripts you intend to run, so you should run `seash.py` from within the `demokit` directory.
* You'll need your Seattle Clearinghouse API keys in the same directory, drop copies of the keys in there too. 


## Submission

Take screenshots of your terminal window when carrying out steps 5, 7, 9, and 11. Place these screenshots together in a pdf file and upload to the [assignment's Moodle page](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=444578).

Each assignment will be accepted for partial credit up to 4 days late, with a penalty of 20% per day.
