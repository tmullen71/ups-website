## Overview

For this class you will work in groups to develop medium-sized software projects over the course of the semester. The nature of each project will be determined by the group, and we will discuss possibilities in class.

All the projects will be "Software as a Service" (SaaS) systems such as web applications. If the project is conceived of as a mobile application, there are several possibilities of how best to implement this in the context of the class, but it may require some additional work to carry out.

You  will be implementing the systems following Agile methodology (which we will study
  further in class). This means that there will be multiple short iterations to be turned in, each with their own requirements and due dates.

## Iteration 0

This preliminary iteration will involve setting up teams and doing a lo-fi "prototype" iteration (without code) to focus on the design.

### Iteration 0.0

**Due Date: Fri 9/11**

*Divide into teams of 5 students (and one team of 4 students)*

Talk to other students and decide who you think you would work well with, as it's a long project. It's a good idea to form groups with a mix of skills and experience so as to better distribute your efforts. I recommend using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/pugetsound/fall2015/csci240/home) to coordinate your team building. If you need any help finding a team contact me *before* the deadline.

Once  you've formed a group, pick a **Team Name** we can refer to each team by!

**Submit** this iteration by having one person create a post on Piazza introducing your team and listing the members (first and last names please!). Tag the post with `#Iter0.0`.

### Iteration 0.1 (2 pts)

**Due Date: Fri 9/18, 11:59 PM**

*Settle on the project concept and choose your on-site customers*

Discuss ideas and possibilities for projects and settle on one of an appropriate size and complexity. Consider what the user's needs are and make everyone understands the goals of the project. The decisions you make here will feed into Iteration 0.2 and your Requirements assignment.

Choose two members of the team to serve as *on-site customers*. These are members of an Agile team who are tasked with representing user/client/customer needs. Other members may contribute suggestions at any time, but these two serve as the authority on the user perspective. If possible, these members should have some real connection to the people who would be using the software.

**Submit** this iteration by having one person create a post on Piazza informally describing the goals of the software and who it's for, and giving the names of your on-site customers. Tag the post with `#Iter0.1`.

### Iteration 0.2 (10 pts)

**Due Date: Fri 10/2, 11:59 PM**

*Work with the customers and generate user stories*

Write a short (2 paragraph max) summary of the main customers' need and how your application will meet that need. Explain the problem, then explain your solution. This summary should act as a "blurb" describing your project.

Create at least 5 user stories on index cards (or quarter-pages). User stories should be in Connextra format:

1.   Feature name
2.   As a [kind of stakeholder],
3.   So that [I can achieve some goal],
4.   I want to [do some task]

Develop these user stories together so that everyone is on the same page! User stories should be [INVEST and SMART](http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/). Note that you will also use the information from these customer discussions to complete Hwk 3.

Submit this iteration by creating a post on Piazza containing your user stories (tag the post with #Iter0.2). You may either submit photos of your index cards or type up the stories.

### Iteration 0.3 (10 pts)

**Due Date: <span style="color:red">Mon</span> 10/12, 11:59 PM**



### Iterations 1-4 (25 pts each)

**Iteration 1 Due Date: Mon 10/26, 11:59 PM**

**Iteration 2 Due Date: Mon 11/9, 11:59 PM**

**Iteration 3 Due Date: Mon 11/23, 11:59 PM**

**Iteration 4 Due Date: Mon 12/16, 4:00 PM**


### Final Presentation (20 pts)
