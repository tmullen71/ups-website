## Overview

Register with the site and complete the
  [JavaScript tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) at Codecademy.com.

This class will require a basic knowledge of JavaScript. I will cover some of the most notable quirks and characteristics of the language in class, but this tutorial will give you some practice and help you get comfortable with using the language.  

Although it's possible to do the tutorial without registering, you will need to register in order to leave off and continue later, and to have a profile page listing your acquired skills.

To submit the assignment, take a screenshot of your profile page showing your name and your acquired skill.
