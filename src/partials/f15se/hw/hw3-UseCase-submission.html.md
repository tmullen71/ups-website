Submit your specification on the [assignment's Moodle page](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=280088). I also encourage you to post it publically on Piazza so that (a) you can share your specification with your team mates, and (b) so that you can share with others examples of how to write these specifications.
