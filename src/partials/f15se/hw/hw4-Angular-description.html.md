## Overview

Tutorial time again! Angular.js is a front-end Model-View-Controller framework developed by Google. It is written in JavaScript, so the basic syntax will be familiar to you. Nevertheless, there's a lot to learn to be able to use it, so this tutorial will help to prepare you for the work you'll do on your final project. The MEAN stack boilerplate you will be working with uses Angular.js as its front-end framework, so it will be necessary to understand Angular.js in order to make sense of what's going on in that project.
