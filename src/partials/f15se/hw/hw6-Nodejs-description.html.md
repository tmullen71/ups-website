## Overview

In pairs, follow the instructions in Chapter 2 of "Node.js In Action", <em>Building a multiroom chat application</em>.

Create a new repository for your pair, using your two last names in alphabetical order, with capitalized first letters (if there are three people in your "pair" use all three names) and underscores between the names. So Sarah Smith and John Jones would create a repo called Jones_Smith.

It doesn't matter which machine you use to code on. You may share a machine or not, but if you use two machines they must both maintain an up-to-date clone of the repository. Take turns in the "driver" and "navigator" roles. Switch every 15 minutes or so. Whenever you switch, commit the changes with a comment saying which of you was the driver and which was the navigator.
