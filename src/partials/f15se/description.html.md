###Course description

In this class students will study tools and methodologies for planning and implementing medium to large-scale software systems. Topics covered include development processes,
design patterns, code organization, version control, code testing,
and collaboration.

There will be individual assignments as well as a group project on which progress will be evaluated incrementally throughout the course.

###Group project

The centerpiece of this class is a group project, in which students will work together in groups to plan and implement a functioning software product.

Students will self-select their teams (with support of the professor). Teams will consist of 4 or 5 students.

All students will be expected to contribute equally to the project. Student contributions will be evaluated through in-class observation, individual final project reports and team evaluations, the final project presentation, and the commit record on the project's Github repository.

Students are responsible for the equitable distribution of work within the group. Group members should make an attempt to identify potential problems early and communicate to the professor if changes need to be made. If other members aren't pulling their weight, don't suffer in silence and do all the work yourself!

The final project will be worth approximately 50% of the total grade.

###Homework assignments

In addition to (and in preparation for) the group project, there are a number of individual homework assignments. These run parallel to group project iterations, but taper off as work on the group project becomes more intense.

Homework assignments as a whole will count for approximately 40% of the total grade.

###Participation

Attendance and participation in class count for approximately 10% of the total grade.

###Prerequisites for this course

The prerequisite for this class is CSCI 261 with a grade of C- or better.
