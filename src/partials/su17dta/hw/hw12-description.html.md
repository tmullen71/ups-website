## Back to the box office!

For this assignment, you'll revisit the theater reservation system you created a few weeks ago using 2D ArrayLists, but revise the code to use
2D arrays. You may use your own completed assignment or this
[starter file](http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/~tmullen/ics/TheaterRows.zip) to get started on this assignment.

## Implementation

The goal is very simple, but the differences between how array lists and arrays work are significant enough that making this change isn't entirely trivial. You'll maintain all of the same methods for your `Reservations`, `Theater`, and `Seat` classes. In fact, `Seat` won't need to change at all. `Theater` will be altered to use an array of seats, rather than an ArrayList of seats. You may need some modifications to `Reservations` as well.
