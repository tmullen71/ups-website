course: Su17 Digital tools for artists
```

### Course description

This course will provide an in-depth introduction to several useful free/open-source digital tools for artists and the conceptual fundamentals to make the most of them. Specifically, the class will cover interactive programming using the Processing environment, and 3D content creation using Blender. The Processing environment enables artists to create interactive installations, programmatic and data-driven visual design, and graphical programs, while serving as an introduction to the basics of computer programming. The Blender 3D suite enables artists to create 3D models, textures, animation, and a wide range of simulations and effects. It can be used to create game or movie assets, visual effects, assets for 3D printing, and many other types of content. Both of the tools are free and available on all common platforms.

The course will be composed of hands-on tutorial-style instruction and less structured work time. Students will create a completed project using the tools of their choice by the end of the course. No computer experience is required or expected.
