### Grading

Grades in the course are based on the following components:

* 25% Programming assignments
* 25% Midterm exam
* 25% Final exam
* 25% Attendance, participation, & labs

More specifically, the following will be expected of you:

**Readings:** Each class will have an accompanying reading assignment taken from the textbook. It is expected that you complete the reading before the corresponding class period. The readings for each class are posted on the calendar above.

**Lab Work:** Lab is a way for you to master the topics covered in class with direct support from the instructor. Lab attendance is mandatory. The lab portion of your grade is derived from attendance and participation during the labs.

**Programming Homework Assignments:** Homework assignments are more substantial projects than lab assignments. Homework assignments are individual assignments. There will be two homework assignments a week, due every Monday and every Thursday. There are no extensions given. Work that is more than a day late will not be accepted.

**Tests:** There will be a midterm exam during class time on Friday, June 3, and a final exam during class time on Friday, June 24. **No rescheduling is possible.** Please do not buy your plane tickets until after our scheduled final exam.
