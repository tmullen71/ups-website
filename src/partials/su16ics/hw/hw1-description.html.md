## Create a new project

Open BlueJ. Create a new project called `hw1`. Make sure this new project is saved inside of the `cs161` folder you created during lab. (Refer back to lab 1 if you forgot how to create a new project in BlueJ).


Again, if you navigate to your `cs161` folder on your system, you'll see that BlueJ has created a new folder called `hw1` and inside of this new folder will be all of the Java code your write for this assignment.

## Programming tasks

* In BlueJ, create a new Java class called `StudentInfo`. Write a method that does prints out, on separate lines, your name, your birthday, your hobbies, your favorite book, and your favorite movie. Each piece of information should be labeled in the output. Use `System.out.println` to output the information.  

* Create another Java class called `AsteriskPicture`. Write a method that uses `System.out.println` to draw a tree using a series of lines of asterisks. Use your imagination and draw whatever kind of tree you like. The picture should be at least 15 lines high.
