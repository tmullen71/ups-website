## Introduction

One of the earliest forms of artificial intelligence (AI) were <em>expert systems</em>. An expert system is a system designed to make decisions or arrive at diagnoses based on information it is given. The decisions it makes are based on a sequence of conditionals.

## Assignment

For this assignment, you will create an expert system to diagnose the cause of a fever. You will use the <span class="codefont">Scanner</span> class to interview a patient about their symptoms.

Look at the image below to see how the symptoms are associated with various possible causes. Your program should ask the pertinent questions and direct the diagnosis as indicated by the chart.

Note that there are many cases of nested conditionals and there are some cases where more than one condition can lead to the same diagnosis. Try to write your program to be as concise as possible, and avoid duplicating  code.
