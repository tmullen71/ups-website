For today’s lab, you’ll be practicing the following skills:

1. Declaring, initializing, and assigning to variables of type int and double
2. Basic arithmetic operations and expressions
3. Casting types

To get started, open BlueJ and create a new project called <span class="codefont">lab2</span>. Make sure you create this new project
inside your <span class="codefont">cs161</span> directory.


### Programming exercises

1. Create a Java class called Arithmetic with a main method and complete exercise 2.11.
   * First, answer questions (a)-(q) on a sheet of paper.
   * Next, check that your answers are correct by copying the code from the book into the main method and inserting print statements.

2. Click [here](http://www.wunderground.com/q/zmw:98406.1.99999?sp=KWATACOM97) to go to Weather Underground for Tacoma, WA. This website compiles a variety of climate data such as high and low temperatures, pressure, visibility, precipitation, etc.
    * Use the data provided on this website to perform arithmetic computations using the four operators: +, −, ∗, and /
    * Ideas include computing differences between high(est) and low(est) values, computing averages and standard deviations, converting between units (e.g. fahrenheit to celsius or fahrenheit to kelvin). Get creative and feel free to search for ideas of things to compute online.
    * Put your code inside a Java class called <span class="codefont">Weather</span>. Print out your computations (along with explanations) to the screen.

## Submitting your lab assignment

Please hand in your written answers for exercise 2.11.

You will be submitting the <span class="codefont">lab2</span> folder that BlueJ created for you. This folder should contain your <span class="codefont">Arithmetic</span> class and your <span class="codefont">Weather</span> class.
