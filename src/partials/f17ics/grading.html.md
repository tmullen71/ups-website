### Grading

Grades in the course are based on the following components:

* 15% Labs
* 25% Programming assignments
* 35% Midterm exams  (2)
* 20% Final exam
* 5% Attendance & participation

More specifically, the following will be expected of you:

**Readings:** Each class will have an accompanying reading assignment taken from the textbook. It is expected that you complete the reading before the corresponding class period. The readings for each class are posted on the calendar above.

**Lab Work:** Lab is a way for you to master the topics covered in class. Lab attendance is mandatory.

**Tests:** There will be two in-class midterm exams and a final exam at the end of the semester. Refer to the calendar for the exam schedule. Details will be given closer to the exam dates.

**Programming Homework Assignments:** Homework assignments are more substantial projects than lab assignments. Homework assignments are individual assignments. You will typically have 1-2 weeks for each assignment. There are no extensions given. Late homework assignments will be penalized by 20% per day, and will not be accepted more than 4 days after the original deadline.

#### Homework grading rubric

Homework grades will be assigned according to the following guidelines:

(Comments, whitespace, variable names and other non-functional style considerations should be commented on in feedback but should not account for more than 5% penalty each and 10% total per assignment, and should not be graded at all until after Week 3).

**100%**   Implements all requested functionality as specified in the instructions. Results are identical to expected results.

**85%-99%** Implements all requested functionality but loses points for style or very minor functionality issues. "Very minor" is subjective, but could refer to situations where the student clearly understands the concepts being dealt with but has overlooked some detail in the implementation. Also, the definition of "very minor" should be less forgiving as the course goes on, or as individual students make the same mistake more than once. (In software, even small errors can have significant consequences, so gradually introducing a more strict interpretation of the requirements is desirable.  

**50%-85%** Mostly works and follows the instructions but has significant functionality issues: e.g. appears to work but returns the wrong answer (in more than minor details), breaks on some expected input values, etc. (If the program works but breaks on unexpected input, it will be noted whether students were required to implement exception handling of any kind. If not, it is assumed that input should be limited to expected values, and points are not docked for breaking on bad input).

**10%-50%** Some required functionality is correctly or near-correctly implemented. E.g., a required method is implemented correctly, but issues elsewhere in the program make the program fail (including failing to compile) overall.

**0%-%10** Program has no redeeming components; student wrote essentially no code. (Partial credit under %10 may include, for example, syntactically correct, originally-named method declarations without any working functionality inside, but this kind of credit will not be given for default BlueJ template content.)​​
