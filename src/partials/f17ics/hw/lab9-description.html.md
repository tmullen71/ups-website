## Processing!

Today's lab is going to be an introduction to the [Processing](https://processing.org/) programming environment. Processing is an integrated Java-based environment for creating graphical, interactive, cross-platform programs quickly and easily. It's widely used for data visualization, prototyping, interactive art, and more.

For this lab, you'll work in pairs on getting a simple PacMan sketch working so that the character chomps properly. Here's the [starter file](http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/~tmullen/ics/Pacman_starter.zip) for the PacMan project.

By the end of the lab you'll be ready to strike out on your own with Processing and tackle implementing a simple recursive function for your upcoming homework assignment.

Please install Processing on your own computers in advance. If necessary, we'll install it on the school computers as well.
