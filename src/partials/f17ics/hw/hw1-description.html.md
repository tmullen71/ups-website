## Create a new project

Open BlueJ. Create a new project called `hw1`. Make sure this new project is saved inside of the `cs161` folder you created during lab. (Refer back to lab 1 if you forgot how to create a new project in BlueJ).


Again, if you navigate to your `cs161` folder on your system, you'll see that BlueJ has created a new folder called `hw1` and inside of this new folder will be all of the Java code your write for this assignment.

## Programming questions

* In BlueJ, create a new Java class called `StudentInfo`. Add a `main` method to this class. In the `main` method, complete programming project 1.3 on page 55 of the textbook.
* Create another Java class called `AsteriskPicture` that has a `main` method. In the `main` method, complete programming project 1.6, creating a picture of a tree. You are completely free to use your imagination and draw any sort of tree, but the picture should be made up of a minimum of 15 lines of asterisks.


## Submitting the assignment

Place all files you created for this assignment in a directory together called `hw1` and create a zip file from the directory. Upload the zip file to the Moodle page for this assignment here: [Moodle](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=407281).

You should make sure you programs are working before submitting them.
Make a note in the comments if you had trouble getting the program to work.
