## Processing!

Today's lab is going to be an introduction to the [Processing](https://processing.org/) programming environment. Processing is an integrated Java-based environment for creating graphical, interactive, cross-platform programs quickly and easily. It's widely used for data visualization, prototyping, interactive art, and more.

For the first half of the lab, we'll take a hands-on tutorial approach and I'll walk you through some Processing code and explain the basics, working through some simple examples and doing some exercises.

For the second half of the lab, you'll work in pairs on getting a simple PacMan sketch working so that the character chomps properly. Here's the [starter file](http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/~tmullen/ics/Pacman_starter.zip) for the PacMan project.

By the end of the lab you'll be ready to strike out on your own with Processing and tackle implementing a simple recursive function for your upcoming homework assignment.



Please try to install Processing on your own computers in advance. If necessary, we'll install it on the school computers as well.
