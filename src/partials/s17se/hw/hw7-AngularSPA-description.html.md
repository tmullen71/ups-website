## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue with the book's sample application and activate the client-side functionality with the Angular.js framework as described in chapters 8, 9 and 10. Angular.js is the front-end framework you'll use on your project. It's very powerful, but it has a fairly steep learning curve. This assignment covers a lot of material, so you are given more time to work on it.

## Chapter notes

Read the [chapter notes](https://github.com/UPS-CSCI240-F16/TonyMullen#chapter-10) in my project repository for details on what is required for these chapters and important tips for working through them.

## GitHub Commits

As in all chapters, you should be committing regularly. You should make at least four meaningful GitHub commits for each chapter of the book.

## Grade weighting & lateness

This assignment has a weight of 10 within the individual assignments portion of your overall grade. Full credit for this assignment depends on the entire contents of the book work from chapter 3 on having been satisfactorily completed, with **all requested screenshots** posted on GitHub. This assignment (i.e. the completed book work) will be accepted for partial credit up to 4 days late, with a penalty of 20% per day.

## Submission

Update the Readme.md describing what you did for this assignment
and detailing any issues you had.

Add the new material for this chapter to the **top** of the Readme.md file, so it's the first thing I see. Make sure the link to the live Heroku application stays on top also.

To submit this assignment go to the [Moodle page for the assignment](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=336599), submit the requested screenshots from Chapters 8, 9 and 10 to Moodle, and enter the link to your GitHub Repository's top page (the same link as for the previous assignment). Make sure that the link is a proper link (i.e. clickable). Also, make sure that your GitHub README.md file contains a (clickable) link to the live application on Heroku.
