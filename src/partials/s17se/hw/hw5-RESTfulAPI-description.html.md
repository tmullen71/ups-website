## **Due Mon 10/3**

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue following the book to create the application described. Work through chapters 6 and 7 on building and consuming a RESTful interface for this assignment's deadline.

As you've done for previous chapters, follow the instructions and get the code running as described in the book. You'll make one small change, however. The book describes formatting the date string in according to UK style standards (day, month, year). **Instead, use the more familiar (to Americans) style of month, day, year. Also, include a comma before the year.** I.e., the date on the customer reviews should read "February 14, 2016" rather than "14 February 2016". In this respect, your live application should look different from mine.

## Chapter notes

Read the [chapter notes](https://github.com/UPS-CSCI240-F16/TonyMullen#chapter-7) in my project repository for details on what is required for these chapters and important tips for working through them.

## GitHub Commits

As in all chapters, you should be committing regularly. You should make at least four meaningful GitHub commits for each chapter of the book.

## Grade weighting & lateness

This assignment has a weight of 1 within the individual assignments portion of your overall grade. Credit for this assignment will not be given after the deadline. You will receive implicit partial credit by turning in subsequent assignments with this work completed.  

## Submission

Update the Readme.md describing what you did for this assignment
and detailing any issues you had.

Add the new material for this chapter to the **top** of the Readme.md file, so it's the first thing I see. Make sure the link to the live Heroku application stays on top also.

To submit this assignment go to the [Moodle page for the assignment](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=336597), submit the requested screenshots from Chapters 6 and 7 to Moodle, and enter the link to your GitHub Repository's top page (the same link as for the previous assignment). Make sure that the link is a proper link (i.e. clickable). Also, make sure that your GitHub README.md file contains a (clickable) link to the live application on Heroku.
