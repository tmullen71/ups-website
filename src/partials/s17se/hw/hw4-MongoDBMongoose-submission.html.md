This assignment should *also* be committed to your personal Github repository and tagged to indicate which chapter work it represents. See the description of the assignment for chapter 3 for details on creating a new remote repo, committing and pushing to it, and tagging. Don't forget to push the tags.

Update the Readme.md describing what you did for this assignment
and detailing any issues you had, including any issues you had getting the live version of the database working on mLab. Mention whether you used the Heroku plugin for mLab or whether you created an mLab account directly.

Add the new material for this chapter to the **top** of the Readme.md file, so it's the first thing I see. Make sure the link to the live Heroku application stays on top. **Double check to make sure that your Heroku application is still working, and that it has been properly hooked up to the mLab database.**

To submit this assignment go to the [Moodle page for the assignment](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=373344) and enter the link to your GitHub Repository's top page (the same link as for the previous assignment). Make sure that the link is a proper link (i.e. clickable). Also, make sure that your GitHub README.md file contains a (clickable) link to the live application on Heroku.
