Submit your specification in **pdf format** on the [assignment's Moodle page](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=373346). **Do not submit .doc, .txt, or any other format files.**

I also encourage you to post it publicly on Piazza so that (a) you can share your specification with your team mates, and (b) so that you can share with others examples of how to write these specifications.
