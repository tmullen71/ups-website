### Primary online resources

The class will make use of several online resources:

The class [Moodle page](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/course/view.php?id=11046) will be where you can turn in assignments and find some class materials.


[Github](https://github.com/UPS-CSCI240-F16) for version/revision control.

[PivotalTracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) for project management.

[Piazza](https://piazza.com/pugetsound/fall2016/csci240/home) for collaboration.

[MEAN Stack Troubleshooting](/~tmullen/pages/meantroubleshoot) is a page of notes and common issues we've seen in the class while working with the MEAN stack. If you have problems with installing or running Node.js, Angular.js, or any other component of the stack, please refer here for any steps you may have overlooked. I'll be adding to this as other issues arise.
