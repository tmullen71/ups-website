## Overview

In this assignment you're going to choose one of three possible project options:

* **Interactive 3D option** For this option, you will create an interactive 3D environment with Three.js. This may be a game, an architectural or other sort of walkthrough, a data visualization environment, or an interactive media artwork. There are no rules regarding what type of work it is, but there are some requirements. The project must have the following characteristics:
    * It must have a significant interactive component. I.e., users should be able to interact with the content in an interesting way. This may mean exploring an environment in a first-person walkthrough style, controlling an avatar, interacting with views for data visualization, et cetera.
    * It should contain at least 5 objects, at least 5 materials, and at least 3 textures (environment textures and cube maps count as single textures). It can of course contain more than this. If your idea is sufficiently complex and does *not* involve using this many assets, please check with me in advance.
    * It should make use of at least 2 features of Three.js that you have not yet dealt with in other assignments. These could include anything from bump maps, to picking, to physics simulation. Check the [Three.js homepage](http://threejs.org/), [Alteredqualia.com](http://alteredqualia.com/), and [Stemkoski's site](https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/) for many great examples. It may of course make use of more than 2 features.
    * You *may* make use of models, textures, materials, or shaders that you find online, provided you give appropriate credit in the readme, you respect any license restrictions on the content, and the main work of the project is your own. Recommended resources include:
      * Models and Blender materials from [Blendswap](http://www.blendswap.com)
      * GLSL shaders from [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com/) (would require adapting to OSL)

* **VFX option** For this option, you will create a short video (one shot) with a 3D VFX component in Blender. It can be of any length and include any content you wish. You may either integrate a real character or element into a CG scene using green screen compositing, or integrate a CG element into a live video shot using camera and/or object tracking, or some combination of the above. The assignment should meet the following criteria:
    * The shot must make use of at least two of the following features.
      * Green screen compositing
      * Camera/object tracking
      * Image-based lighting
      * OSL shaders
    * You *may* make use of models, textures, materials, plates or shaders that you find online, provided you give appropriate credit in the readme, you respect any license restrictions on the content, and the main work of the project is your own. Recommended resources include:
      * Green screen plates from [Hollywood Camera Work](http://www.hollywoodcamerawork.com/greenscreenplates.html) (terrific resource for VFX!)
      * Models and Blender materials from [Blendswap](http://www.blendswap.com)
      * GLSL shaders from [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com/) (would require adapting to OSL)

* **Ray tracer option** For this option, you will continue working on the ray tracer you began for assignment 5, implementing *at minimum* 3 features from the following list (in no particular order):
    * Matrix transformations
    * Transparency/diffraction
    * Antialiasing
    * Soft shadows
    * Depth of field
    * Motion blur
    * Texture mapping
    * Environment mapping

Regardless of which assignment you choose, be sure to describe what you did and what your goal was with the project in the README. Discuss challenges or problems that arose and describe what you learned in your attempts to solve the problems, and any other points you think I should take into consideration when grading the assignment.

## Evaluation

This assignment will be graded on execution and creativity. The assignment should meet the criteria listed and should also be an interesting and effective use of the medium you chose. Try to balance ambition with a realistic sense of what you can accomplish in the time allotted.
