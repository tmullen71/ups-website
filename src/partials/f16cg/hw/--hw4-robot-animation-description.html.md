## Overview

In this exercise you're going to finish the robot project by adding animation and interactivity.

## Requirements

The robot's arm should be controllable. Use the dat.GUI library to add three sliders, as you see below. One of the sliders should control swivel at the base of the robot's arm, enabling it to rotate 180 degrees in either direction. The next slider should control the joing of the robot's arm, enabling it to bend 90 degrees in either direction. The third slider should control the robot's claw, enabling it to open and close, as in the example below.

Next, the robot should be able to walk. Use the W key to make the robot walk forward, the A key to make the robot turn left, and the S key to make the robot turn right. Make the robot's legs move when any of these keys are being pressed, and make them stop when the keys are released.

The leg movement won't be perfect. As you can see in the example below, the legs appear to slide on the ground. This is an issue that is beyond the scope of this assignment. For now, it is enough to have the legs move back and forth continuously at a roughly decent looking speed.

Finally, make some characteristic of your robot move continuously. In the example below, the eye parts meet this criteria.

## Evaluation

Completing this assignment on time to the specifications described above is worth 8 points out of a possible 10 points. Further points will be awarded on the basis of creativity, design, and/or additional complexity. If you used interesting features of Three.js that have not been discussed, or if you added something to the assignment that may not be immediately obvious to me, be sure to make a note of it in the README, so that I know what to credit you for.

## Submitting

To submit this work, upload it with all necessary files in its own subdirectory of your public_html directory so that it can be viewed in a browser. Test it in a browser to make sure that it's working! (If it works differently in different browsers make a note of that in the README file).

After you've uploaded the work and checked it in the browser, submit the README.txt to Moodle.
