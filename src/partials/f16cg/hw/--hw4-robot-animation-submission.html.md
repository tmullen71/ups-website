To submit this work, upload it with all necessary files in its own subdirectory of your public_html directory so that it can be viewed in a browser. Test it in a browser to make sure that it's working! (If it works differently in different browsers make a note of that in the README file).

After you've uploaded the work and checked it in the browser, submit the README.txt to Moodle.
