Upload the project to its own directory inside your `public_html` directory using FileZilla (this should be a separate directory from Hws 7 and 8. Duplicate the files from  Hw 8 to work on this one). Be sure that all dependencies are in place and **Double check that your finished work displays properly in a browser online.** The directory should include the completed `README.txt`, which should also be viewable in the browser.

In Moodle, add a link to your finished assignment's public URL.
