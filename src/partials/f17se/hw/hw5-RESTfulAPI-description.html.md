## **Due Mon 2/20**

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue following the book to create the application described. Work through chapters 6 and 7 on building and consuming a RESTful interface for this assignment's deadline.

As you've done for previous chapters, follow the instructions and get the code running as described in the book. You'll make one small change, however. The book describes formatting the date string in according to UK style standards (day, month, year). **Instead, use the more familiar (to Americans) style of month, day, year. Also, include a comma before the year.** I.e., the date on the customer reviews should read "February 14, 2016" rather than "14 February 2016". In this respect, your live application should look different from mine.

## Chapter notes

Read the [chapter notes](https://github.com/UPS-CSCI240-S17/TonyMullen#chapter-7) in my project repository for details on what is required for these chapters and important tips for working through them.

## GitHub Commits

As in all chapters, you should be committing regularly. You should make at least four meaningful GitHub commits for each chapter of the book.

## Grade weighting & lateness
