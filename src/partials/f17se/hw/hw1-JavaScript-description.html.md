## **Due Wed 9/6**

## Overview

Register with the site and complete the
  [JavaScript tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) at Codecademy.com.

This class will require a basic knowledge of JavaScript. I will cover some of the most notable quirks and characteristics of the language in class, but this tutorial will give you some practice and help you get comfortable with using the language.  

Although it's possible to do the tutorial without registering, you will need to register in order to leave off and continue later, and to have a profile page listing your acquired skills.

This assignment includes a total of 8 interactive lessons, which are unlocked as you progress through the course. If you click on the `syllabus` tab on the tutorial course page you can see the progression. You do not need to do any of the lessons or quizzes marked "PRO".

**Note** Contrary to the impression you might get from the unfortunate similarity in names, [*JavaScript is not related to Java*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#JavaScript_and_Java). This tutorial isn't meant as a refresher of CS 161. Apart from some superficial syntactic similarities (which both languages inherited from C) and a few other shared conventions, JavaScript is a completely separate (and quite different) language.
