## **Due  Mon 10/30**

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue with the book's sample application and activate the client-side functionality with the Angular.js framework as described in chapters 8, 9 and 10. Angular.js is the front-end framework you'll use on your project. It's very powerful, but it has a fairly steep learning curve. This assignment covers a lot of material, so you are given more time to work on it.

## Chapter notes

Read the [chapter notes](https://github.com/UPS-CSCI240-S17/TonyMullen#chapter-10) in my project repository for details on what is required for these chapters and important tips for working through them.

## GitHub Commits

As in all chapters, you should be committing regularly. You should make at least four meaningful GitHub commits for each chapter of the book.
