Submit your specification in **pdf format** on the [assignment's Moodle page](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=407265). **Do not submit .doc, .txt, or any other format files. Make sure your name is written on the document.** Wrong file format submissions and submissions without names will each be penalized by 10%.

I also encourage you to post it publicly on Piazza so that (a) you can share your specification with your team mates, and (b) so that you can share with others examples of how to write these specifications.
