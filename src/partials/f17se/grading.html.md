### Grading

This course will be graded based on the following factors:

* 5% Attendance & participation
* 5% Quizzes
* 40% Individual homework
* 50% Group project

There are no midterms or final exams for this course. Quizzes will be announced at least one class period in advance.

Weighting values for individual homework assignments and group iterations can be found on the corresponding assignment or iteration's description page.

### Group project

The centerpiece of this class is a group project, in which students will work together in groups to plan and implement a functioning software product.

Students will self-select their teams (with support of the professor). Teams will consist of 3 to 5 students (optimally 4).

All students will be expected to contribute approximately equally to the group project. A single value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 will represent an individual's overall contribution to their group's project. The value defaults to 1.0 and will stay at that value if there are no issues with the individual's contribution. **An individual's final grade for the group project (worth 50% of their course grade) will be multiplied by this value.** Student contributions will be evaluated according to team evaluations, informal observation, the commit record on the project's GitHub repository, and any other relevant factors. **Contributing meaningfully to the development of the group project (not just the final presentation) is the single most important factor in your grade in this class.**

Students are responsible for the equitable distribution of work within the group. Group members should make an attempt to identify potential problems early and communicate to the professor if changes need to be made. If other members aren't pulling their weight, don't suffer in silence, for their own good as well as yours!

### Homework assignments

In addition to (and in preparation for) the group project, there are a number of individual homework assignments. These run parallel to group project iterations, but taper off as work on the group project becomes more intense.

Homework assignments as a whole will count for approximately 40% of the total grade. Your performance on homework will also be a factor that I will look at if there are doubts about your contributions on the final project.

Much of the homework involves following the tutorial-style presentation of the *Getting MEAN* book. This requires reading the text, entering the code, and producing a working version of the project described by the book.

Book chapter assignments are credited for being submitted *by the deadline*. Completion of the full book is weighted more heavily than individual chapters, so "late work" on book chapters is credited *implicitly* through credit on later chapters. This means that missed deadlines **can not be made up**. Be aware that these assignments are cumulative, and so catching up is increasingly difficult as you fall behind.

### Participation

Attendance and participation in class count for 5% of the total grade, overall.
However, attendance and participation issues may also be reflected in the contribution score for your final group project.

### Quizzes

There will be occasional short quizzes covering recent reading and/or lecture material. These will be announced at least one class period in advance. Your average score on these quizzes will account for 5% of your total grade.
