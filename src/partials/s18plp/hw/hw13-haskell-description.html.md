## Exercise 1

We'll return to the state-transition networks we looked at in [Homework 7](http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/~tmullen/hw/s18plp/hw7-prolog/). In this exercise you will
work from [starter code]() written in Haskell to implement functions that give paths through
the network along the same lines of those you implemented in Prolog. 

Recall the first network:

And the second one:

## Submitting

Submit this assignment on [Moodle](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=374239) as a single `.hs` file. Be sure that your name is written in the file in a comment. (Comments in Haskell are preceded by `--`) and of course double check to make sure the code runs.
