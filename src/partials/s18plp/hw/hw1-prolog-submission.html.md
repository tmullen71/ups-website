For non-coding questions, write out your answers in a file called
`hwk<number>-<your_name>.txt`. Be sure to include your name in the text of the file itself.

For coding assignmets, write all the predicates and facts for this assignment in one file, called
`hwk<number>-<your_name>.pl`. Separate the code for each exercise within the file with comments indicating which code goes with which exercise. Put your own name in a comment at the top of the file. Like so:

    %Your Name
    %
    %Exercise 1

    ...

    %Exercise 2

    ...


Submit the file on [Moodle](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/course/view.php?id=12385).

Of course, you should make sure you programs are working before submitting them.
Make a note in the comments if you had trouble getting the program to work.
