course: S18 Programming Language Paradigms
```

### Course description

In this class students will study the differences between
programming language paradigms and become acquainted with
styles of programming other than the most widely used
procedural and object-oriented styles.

Lectures and readings will provide an overview of some of the
most important programming paradigms, including logic programming,
dataflow programming, and functional programming.

Much of the course will be dedicated to acquiring practical working
competency in two specific languages representing key programming
paradigms, namely Prolog for logic programming, and Haskell for
functional programming.
