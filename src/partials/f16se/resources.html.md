### Primary online resources

The class will make use of several online resources:

The class [Moodle page](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/course/view.php?id=10616) will be where you can turn in assignments and find some class materials.

[Github](https://github.com/UPS-CS240-S16) for version/revision control.

[PivotalTracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) for project management.

[Piazza](https://piazza.com/pugetsound/spring2016/csci240/home) for collaboration.

[MEAN Stack Troubleshooting](/~tmullen/pages/meantroubleshoot) is a page of notes and common issues we've seen in the class while working with the MEAN stack. If you have problems with installing or running Node.js, Angular.js, or any other component of the stack, please refer here for any steps you may have overlooked. I'll be adding to this as other issues arise. 




### Supplemental resources

#### Books

Douglas Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts is one of the best known
JavaScript books and I recommend it, as well as Crockford's website and videos.

There are many other worthwhile books on JavaScript, Node.js, Angular.js
and related technology. Some recommended, freely available ones are:

Eloquent Javascript 2nd Ed by Marijn Haverbeke
http://eloquentjavascript.net/

Node Up and Running by Tom Hughes-Croucher & Mike Wilson
http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/index.html

The Little MongoDB Book by Karl Seguin
http://openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf

A list of freely available eBooks (of various degrees of completeness/usefulness)
can be found here:

In addition to the ones listed as textbooks for this course, the following are
particularly recommended.

Learning JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani

Recipes with Angular.js by Frederik Dietz is a straightforward and practial eBook that
will help you get started with AngularJS quickly.

Finally, not an eBook but a fairly definitive introduction to Angular.js:
