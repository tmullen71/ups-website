## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue following the book to create the application described. The next few chapters involve working with MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the data model that will form the backbone of the application. **You should complete the work through chapter 5 for this assignment's deadline.** It is important for you to understand how data is stored and retrieved between the database and the application controller in a MEAN stack application. This stuff *will* come up again in your group project.

This will require a working local installation of MongoDB. If you run into insurmountable problems installing this (or other) software on your own computer you may see me for help, but *be prepared to do the work on a university computer instead*. Your laptop isn't getting graded in this class, you are.

**Note: There is a typo on page 151 that could cause confusing issues later. In the code for updating the subdocument, the key shown as <span class="codefont">id</span> should be <span class="codefont">_id</span>. Be sure to enter this with the underscore.**

For this assignment you will also need an account on MongoLab. You may either use the Heroku plugin (which requires credit card information for security purposes, but is free) or you can create a MongoLab account directly by hand, which is also free and does not require a credit card. Instructions for both ways are in the book.

Finally, although it is not a requirement, I strongly recommend installing [Robomongo](https://robomongo.org/) to help with your MongoDB administration. The book gives valuable instructions on working with MongoDB from the command line. Robomongo enables you to look at your databases using a nice GUI environment and edit documents in databases simply and directly. It's a great resource for MongoDB.
