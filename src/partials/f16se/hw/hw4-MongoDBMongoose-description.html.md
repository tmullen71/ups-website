## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue following the book to create the application described. The next few chapters involve working with MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the data model that will form the backbone of the application. **You should complete the work through chapter 5 for this assignment's deadline.** It is important for you to understand how data is stored and retrieved between the database and the application controller in a MEAN stack application. This stuff *will* come up again in your group project.

This will require a working local installation of MongoDB. If you run into insurmountable problems installing this (or other) software on your own computer you may see me for help.

For this assignment you will also need an account on MongoLab. You may either use the Heroku plugin (which requires credit card information for security purposes, but is free) or you can create a MongoLab account directly by hand, which is also free and does not require a credit card. Instructions for both ways are in the book.

Ultimately, you will wind up with two databases, one which runs on your local computer and one which serves your live (Heroku) application which runs on mLab. The contents of these databases are independent of each other (using `mongodump` and `mongorestore` as described in the book is the way to move content from one database to another).

## Chapter notes

Read the [chapter notes](https://github.com/UPS-CSCI240-F16/TonyMullen#chapter-5) in my project repository for details on what is required for this chapter and important tips for working through the chapter.  


#### RoboMongo

I **strongly recommend** installing [Robomongo](https://robomongo.org/) to help with your MongoDB administration. The book gives valuable instructions on working with MongoDB from the command line. Robomongo enables you to look at your databases using a nice GUI environment and edit documents in databases simply and directly. It's a great resource for MongoDB.

## Submission

Update the Readme.md describing what you did for this assignment
and detailing any issues you had. Mention in the Readme.md file what the typo was in the book and what you had to do to fix the file in question so the application worked.

Add the new material for this chapter to the **top** of the Readme.md file, so it's the first thing I see. Make sure the link to the live Heroku application stays on top also.

To submit this assignment go to the [Moodle page for the assignment](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=336596) and enter the link to your GitHub Repository's top page (the same link as for the previous assignment). Make sure that the link is a proper link (i.e. clickable). Also, make sure that your GitHub README.md file contains a (clickable) link to the live application on Heroku.
