This assignment should *also* be committed to your personal Github repository and tagged to indicate which chapter work it represents. See the description of the assignment for chapter 3 for details on creating a new remote repo, committing and pushing to it, and tagging. Don't forget to push the tags.  

Edit your repo's Readme.md describing what you did and detailing any issues you had. Also, mention in the Readme.md file what the typo was in the book and what you had to do to fix the file in question so the application worked.

The Readme.md file is the first place I will look to make sure you did this assignment, so make sure to include/update it!
