## **Due Wed 3/2**

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue following the book to create the application described. Work through chapters 6 and 7 on building and consuming a RESTful interface for this assignment's deadline.

As you've done for previous chapters, follow the instructions and get the code running as described in the book. You'll make one small change, however. The book describes formatting the date string in according to UK style standards (day, month, year). **Instead, use the more familiar (to Americans) style of month, day, year. Also, include a comma before the year.** I.e., the date on the customer reviews should read "February 14, 2016" rather than "14 February 2016".

Note: There are some recurring typos in which the author seems to have confused <span class="codefont">/locations/</span> with <span class="codefont">/location/</span> in the project URL. To be clear, they should *all* be <span class="codefont">/locations/</span>. If you have <span class="codefont">/location/</span> as a part of any URL on your site, it's probably not right (unless they are all that way).
