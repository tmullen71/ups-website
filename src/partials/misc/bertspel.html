    <p>This puzzle is credited to <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/">Bert Bos</a>. I learned of it from
    <a href="http://www.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/">Gertjan van Noord</a>. He explains it as follows:</p>
    <p>
    The puzzle consists of a square of n x n blue tiles. The back side of each tile is red.
    The object of the puzzle is to turn every tile, so that the whole square becomes red.
  </p>
  <p>
  However, when a tile is turned, its four neighbors also turn.
  With every turn, therefore, five tiles swap color.

    Hints for solving the puzzle
  </accordion-heading>
  <ol>
    <li>The order of turning tiles is immaterial.</li>
    <li>No tile needs to be turned twice.</li>
    <li>All solutions can be mirrored in several ways.</li>
      <li>Selecting a top row determines all other rows.</li>
</ol>
  Observation 4 is due to Harry Bos and is a key insight.
  You can view the top row as a sequence of n bits.
  There are 2**n possibilities, which can be specified with
  the bit patterns corresponding to the numbers
  between 0 and 2**n-1.
  These 2**n possibilities include all mirrored solutions.
