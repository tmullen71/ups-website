## Overview

For your first two assignments, you'll be familiarizing yourself with the Python programming language using the [Codecademy Python tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). If you haven't registered for a Codecademy account, please do that first. You'll need an account before you begin the tutorial in order to collect the badges.

Python is a very powerful and very widely used multipurpose, multi-paradigm programming language and a great language to know. It's also the language that your programming assignments in this class will be carried out in, so I want you to be comfortable with it.

You'll find it similar to the object-oriented and procedural languages you've studied in the past, but with enough important differences that putting in a bit of time to follow a serious tutorial will be beneficial.

I'm breaking the tutorial into several parts to spread the work out a bit, and you may skip components of the tutorial that are not listed among the required portions below. The required portions are as follows:

### Assignment 1 (Due Mon, Jan 23)

For part one of this assignment, complete the following five sections. Each of these sections will earn you a "badge" with the name of the section.

**Python Syntax**

**Strings and Console Output**

**Conditionals and Control Flow**

**Functions**

**Lists & Dictionaries**
