### Online resources

The class [Moodle page](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/course/view.php?id=11828) will be where you can turn in assignments and find some class materials.

##### Seattle

We will be using [Seattle](https://seattle.poly.edu/html/) for some of the exercises in this course. You will need to register to use the [Seattle Clearinghouse](https://seattleclearinghouse.poly.edu/html/login) tools.

##### Python

You should install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) if you haven't already. If you are working on Mac OS X, you may already have Python 2.7 installed. It's not a problem to have them both installed.
