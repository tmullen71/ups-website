## **Due  Fri 5/6**

## Overview

For this assignment, you will write a short (2 to 3 page) paper applying two different forms of ethical reasoning to an ethical dilemma related to the field of Software Engineering (and Computer Science more broadly). This will give you an opportunity to dig more deeply into a software-related social issue, and to practice using effective written communication in regards to technical systems.

You will be required to turn in a draft of the paper, as well as a revised copy. Iterate your writing!

Note: this homework assignment will be given **twice** the weight of a regular assignment (it counts as double).

## Objectives

* Practice applying ethical reasoning to the development of software systems
* Consider multiple systems for making ethical decisions
* Practice with persuasive writing about technical systems

## Assignment Details

In this assignment, you will be writing about a single ethical decision (of your choice) posed by an aspect of a software development project. For example, you might consider the decision to [utilize social network members as participants in psychological/sociological experiments](http://www.wsj.com/articles/furor-erupts-over-facebook-experiment-on-users-1404085840). You may choose your own situation (e.g., based on the readings from class or your own interests/experience). Note that your situation should be reflect an actual real-life dilemma; it will not be a simple case study as in the Brinkman reading. (The situation may be hypothetical, but should be grounded in actual events).

Once you have chosen a situation, you should analyze the situation using **two (2)** different ethical theories that we discussed in class:

1. Virtue Ethics
2. Utilitarian Ethics (act or rule)
3. Deontological Ethics

You will apply each of these ethical systems to the situation and determine the ethical course of action, comparing and contrasting the results.

## Paper Content

* Your paper should briefly (in a few sentence) describe the situation to situate the reader--however, do not spend too much time before getting into your analysis!
  * Be sure and identify the dilemma! What decision is being made, and what conflicting set of motivations make this a dilemma?
  * If there is only one "obvious" choice, then it isn't an ethical decision!
* Use ethical reasoning (as described by Brinkman) to determine the best course of action each of your chosen ethical theories in isolation.
  * Note that ethical reasoning using a particular ethical system may not lead you to a conclusion that you personally deem "correct" (e.g., that matches with your own personal ethical code). That is okay and even expected--the goal is to consider a situation from an alternative point of view.
  * The two ethical systems may come to either the same or different conclusions on which course of action to take. This is normal---indeed, ethical systems often agree with one another, just with a different basis for the decision!
* You should conclude your essay with a short consideration of the distinctions between these systems for your situation. Did they come to different decisions or the same? Are those decisions based on similar or different factors? Would one theory be more "applicable" than another in this situation?


## Submitting

The paper should be submitted on Moodle [here](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=308427).

* Files should be in **.pdf format**. **No Word files** please.

Please remember to put your name on your papers (and to give your final submissions one last read-through for typos and writing issues!)
