## Overview

For this assignment, you'll continue with the book's sample application and activate the client-side functionality with the Angular.js framework as described in chapters 8, 9 and 10. You've already scratched the surface with Angular.js in the previous assignment's tutorial, so the concepts and terminology should be familiar, but this assignment will dig deeper into how Angular.js integrates with other components to create an application.
