## Overview

Web development can be a very start-and-stop process. The project
 may need to be rebuilt when files are edited, files may need to be
uploaded to the web server, the web server may need to be re-started to
handle server-side changes, the browser will need to be refreshed to
display new content. Although each step on its own may seem insignificant,
doing all these things by hand over and over again becomes a terrible time sink.

Continuous development tools enable you to spend your time working on code by handling these things automatically.

This assignment is a continuation of the previous assignment. Follow the steps from
section 3.4 to the end of Chapter 3 in Build First in order to set your environment
up for continuous development.

Update the README describing what you did for this assignment
and detailing any issues you had. The README is the first place
I will look to make sure you did this assignment, so make sure to
include/update it!
