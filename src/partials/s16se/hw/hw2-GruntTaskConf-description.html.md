## Overview

Grunt is a task automation tool for JavaScript. Configured properly it will carry out a wide variety of important tasks for you, eliminating the need to do them manually.

When you begin your group project, you will be using a readymade boilerplate project to start from, which makes heavy use of Grunt. In order to understand what's going on in this project, you must understand what Grunt is doing and how it's configured.

The book *JavaScript Application Development: A Build-First Approach* places great emphasis on automation with Grunt. For this assignment, you will follow the steps in chapter 2 of the book, from the beginning of the chapter through section 2.4, to set up your Grunt configuration.

The results will be committed to your personal Github repository, which we will set up in class. Within your individual repo you should create a directory called <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, 'Lucida Sans Typewriter', 'Lucida Typewriter', monospace;">build-first</span>. Commit this assignment to the repo inside this directory.

Include a README describing what you did and detailing any issues you had. The README is the first place I will look to make sure you did this assignment, so make sure to include/update it!
