### Supplemental resources

#### Books

Douglas Crockford's JavaScript: The Good Parts is one of the best known
JavaScript books and I recommend it, as well as Crockford's website and videos.

There are many other worthwhile books on JavaScript, Node.js, Angular.js
and related technology. Some recommended, freely available ones are:

Eloquent Javascript 2nd Ed by Marijn Haverbeke
http://eloquentjavascript.net/

Node Up and Running by Tom Hughes-Croucher & Mike Wilson
http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/index.html

The Little MongoDB Book by Karl Seguin
http://openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf

A list of freely available eBooks (of various degrees of completeness/usefulness)
can be found here:

In addition to the ones listed as textbooks for this course, the following are
particularly recommended.

Learning JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani

Recipes with Angular.js by Frederik Dietz is a straightforward and practial eBook that
will help you get started with AngularJS quickly.

Finally, not an eBook but a fairly definitive introduction to Angular.js:
