## Bert Bos Puzzle, Haskell edition

Once again you'll tackle the [Bert Bos Puzzle](/~tmullen/pages/bertspel). This time, you'll do it individually, rather than working in pairs.

This time, you will (hopefully) begin armed with some insight into how to break down the task from having solved it in Prolog. But as you'll see, the languages are different enough that it's not trivial to convert your results from one language to the other.

Doing the same exercise in both languages should help you to get a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between the languages. As you carry out this exercise, think about how you might approach it in an object-oriented imperative language such as Java. Consider whether the task lends itself to one or another style of programming.
