## Create a new project

Open BlueJ. Create a new project called <span class="codefont">hw2</span>. Make sure this new project is saved inside of the <span class="codefont">cs161</span> folder you created during lab 1. (Refer back to lab 1 if you forgot how to create a new project in BlueJ).

1. Complete programming project 2.11 on page 109 of your textbook. Name your Java class <span class="codefont">Money</span>. Here's an example of the output your program should produce.

2. Starting with homework 2, your code will be graded not only on functionality but also on *good style*. Good programming style refers to the readability and maintainability of your code. We'll talk about this more as the semester continues. For now, please make sure your code is commented and that your variable names are informative and appropriate.

Place a block comment before the class declaration that contains your name and a brief description of the class.

    /*
    * Name
    * Brief description of the class
    */

Also, add inline comments (using //) wherever you feel your code is complicated and someone reading your code might appreciate an explanation of what you're doing.

Finally, choose appropriate variable names. Naming the variable that stores the amount of money the user entered <span class="codefont">frodo</span> or <span class="codefont">punchMe</span> (while humorous) is not helpful to anyone reading your code.

## Submitting the assignment

Place all files you created for this assignment in a directory together called <span class="codefont">hw2</span> and create a zip file from the directory. Upload the zip file to the [Moodle page for this assignment](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=318509).

You should make sure you programs are working before submitting them.
Make a note in the comments if you had trouble getting the program to work.
