For today's lab you'll be doing two problems: programming project 2.2 on page 108 of your textbook and exercise 2.11 on page 107. Open BlueJ and create a new project called <span class="codefont">lab2</span>.


### Programming exercises

1. Complete programming project 2.2. Name your Java class <span class="codefont">Average</span>.

    Note that question 2.2 requires you to use a <span class="codefont">Scanner</span> object to read in numbers from the keyboard. The <span class="codefont">Scanner</span> class was written by someone else and is a part of the Java library. If you remember the first day of class, we talked about the Java compilation process:
    <img src="/~tmullen/images/ics/lab2_compiling.png" style="width: 100%;"/>

    In order to run your code, you need to have access to all the "library files" that your code uses -- i.e. you need  to have access to the <span class="codefont">Scanner</span> class. To import the <span class="codefont">Scanner</span> class into your code, type the following at the very top of your Java file:

        java.util.Scanner;

    Note, <span class="codefont">java.util.Scanner</span> is the full name of the <span class="codefont">Scanner</span> class. Below is a screenshot of what my <span class="codefont">Average</span> class does when the <span class="codefont">main</span> method is called:
    <img src="/~tmullen/images/ics/lab2_terminal.png" style="width: 100%;"/>

2. Complete exercise 2.11. First, answer questions (a)-(q) on a sheet of paper. Then, create a BlueJ class called <span class="codefont">Arithmetic</span> with a <span class="codefont">main</span> method. In the <span class="codefont">main</span> method, check that your answers are correct. That is, copy the code from the book and put in print statements to check your answers.

## Submitting your lab assignment

Please hand in your written answers for exercise 2.11.

You will be submitting the <span class="codefont">lab2</span> folder that BlueJ created for you. This folder should contain your <span class="codefont">Average</span> class and your <span class="codefont">Arithmetic</span> class.

The Moodle page to submit this lab can be found [here](https://moodle.pugetsound.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=318508)). See the Lab 1 description for more details on how to submit to Moodle.
