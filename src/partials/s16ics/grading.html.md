### Grading

Grades in the course are based on four components:

* 15% Lab Assignments
* 30% Programming Assignments
* 35% Midterm Exams (2)
* 20% Final Exam

More specifically, the following will be expected of you:

**Readings:** Each class will have an accompanying reading assignment taken from the textbook. It is expected that you complete the reading before the corresponding class period. The readings for each class are posted on the course webpage under “Lectures”.

**Lab Assignments:** Lab is a way for you to master the topics covered in-class. Lab attendance is mandatory. Lab assignments are due the following Friday by 11:59pm. There are no extensions given for lab assignments. Late lab assignments will be penalized by 3n% for n ≤ 4 where n is the number of days the assignment is
submitted late.

**Programming Homework Assignments:** Homework assignments are more substantial projects than lab assignments. Homework assignments are individual assignments. You will typically have 1-2 weeks for each assignment. There are no extensions given. Late homework assignments will be penalized by 3n% for n ≤ 4 where n is the number of days the assignment is submitted late.

**Tests:** There will be two in-class midterm exams and a final exam at the end of the semester. The final exam is scheduled for December 14th at 8am. Please do not buy your plane tickets until after our scheduled
final exam. Details will be given closer to the exam dates.
